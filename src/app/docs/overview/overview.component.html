            <!-- Additionally, Programmable Video provides the missing pieces required to use WebRTC to build sophisticated applications:
         Global STUN/TURN relays, media services for large-scale group conferences and recording, and signaling infrastructure are all included. -->
            <p>
                <strong>ApiRTC</strong> helps to fastly build communication applications, from simple chat to rich media sharing.

                It provides both <strong>infrastructure</strong> and <strong>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</strong> to take benefit from it.

            <h1 class="text-center">APIs</h1>

            <p><strong>ApiRTC</strong> provides APIS to help you programming your apps or services in many languages.</p>

            <h2><strong>Javascript</strong> library</h2>
            <p>For a client <strong>web-app</strong>, Javascript API can be integrated in your vanilla HTML/<img width="30" src="./assets/javascript.png">javascript or into any modern web application framework such as <img width="30" src="./assets/angular.png">Angular,
                <img width="30" src="./assets/react.jpg">React, or <img width="30" src="./assets/vue.png">Vue.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>Android and iOS</strong> SDKs</h2>

            <h1 class="text-center">Infrastructure</h1>

            <h2><strong>Signalisation</strong> server</h2>
            <p>In order to realize a WebRTC application, one must establish a connection between the browsers that want to communicate. WebRTC provides the solution for the media plane but does not implement the signaling, i.e. how one client’s information
                should be sent to remote peers in order to initiate connections.
                <strong>ApiRTC cloud</strong> implements a signaling server using WebSockets. The browser and server interaction is event-based : the browser does not have to poll the server for a reply every time data have to be exchanged.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-end"><strong>ApiRTC</strong>&nbsp;<strong>signalisation</strong> enables very fast and interactive communication</p>

            <h2><strong>Star topology</strong> infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Basic <strong>WebRTC</strong> applications are using full mesh topology. Each client must :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>encode and send their stream(s) to each remote peer</li>
                <li>receive and decode every remote peer stream(s)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The CPU load and the required bandwidth increases linearly as the number of peers and streams grows. This topology is unsuitable for applications where larger groups of peers need to be connected at once.
            </p>
            <p><strong>ApiRTC</strong> enables the usage of a <strong>star topology</strong> by providing SFUs (Selective Forwarding Units) that acts as a central server that relays each peers’ streams.</p>
            <p>MCU (stands for Multipoint Control Unit) can also be used (TODO: check this ?)</p>

            <p class="lead text-end">Providing <strong>star topology</strong> infrastructures, <strong>ApiRTC</strong> enables large scale group conversations support</p>

            <h2><strong>STUN/TURN</strong> servers</h2>
            <p>To send and receive data to another browser the client must have some specific information. The most important information is the client’s public IP address. Each client or browser must know this information about each other in order to receive
                an incoming connection from another client. Sometimes it’s difficult for the client to know its own public IP address, especially if the client is behind a firewall or NAT, which is very common these days. To overcome this, WebRTC recommends
                the use of a STUN server. A STUN server allows clients to find out their own public IP address and which type of NAT they are behind. Sometimes it can be hard to fetch the information, depending on the NAT, and in that case, a TURN server
                can help the process.</p>
            <p class="lead text-end"><strong>ApiRTC</strong> provides both STUN and TURN servers</p>
