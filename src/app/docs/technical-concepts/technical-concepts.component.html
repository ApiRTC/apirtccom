            <h1>Technical concepts</h1>

            <p>Any ApiRTC application, involves at least two software parts, the <strong>client application</strong> and
                <strong>ApiRTC platform</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Client application</h2>
            <p>The client application is the web or mobile application final users are using to interact together. It allows the user to share messages or media, and it displays messages or media from the other participants</p>

            <h2>ApiRTC platform</h2>

            <h3>ApiRTC cloud</h3>

            <p>ApiRTC cloud is responsible for the signaling.</p>

            <h3>ApiRTC STUN/TURN</h3>

            <h3>ApiRTC SFUs</h3>

            <p>Tell about peer-to-peer, mesh mode, star topolofy SFUs... :</p>

            <p>In ApiRTC, media streams flow through ApiRTC infrastructure SFUs.</p>

            <p>But you can control that my enabling meshMode, and event force it remain mesh. Otherwise ApiRTC will automatically try to switch to star topology architecture.</p>
